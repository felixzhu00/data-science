# NYC Airbnb Data Analysis

## Overview

This assignment involves analyzing the New York City Airbnb Open Data. The primary task is to mine the data to uncover interesting observations about different hosts and areas. Ensure the code is well-documented with comments and includes the exact sequence of operations needed to produce the resulting tables and figures.

## Tasks

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Examine the data for anomalies.
- Clean the data as needed.
- Document the steps taken to clean the data.

### 2. Price Analysis by Neighborhood
- Analyze how Airbnb prices vary with the neighborhood.
  - Identify the top 5 and bottom 5 neighborhoods based on Airbnb prices (consider neighborhoods with more than 5 listings).
  - Analyze the price variation between different neighborhood groups and plot these trends.

### 3. Correlation Analysis
- Select a set of the most interesting features.
- Perform a pairwise Pearson correlation analysis on all pairs of these variables.
- Display the results with a heatmap and identify the most positive and negative correlations.

### 4. Geospatial Analysis
- Use the latitude and longitude data of Airbnb listings to create visualizations.
  - Plot a scatter plot based on these coordinates, color-coded by neighborhood group.
  - Plot another scatter plot based on these coordinates, color-coded by Airbnb prices (for listings priced less than $1000). Identify the most expensive neighborhood group based on the plot.

### 5. Word Cloud Generation
- Extract words from the names of Airbnb listings.
- Generate a word cloud to visualize the most common words.

### 6. Host Activity Analysis
- Identify areas with the busiest hosts (hosts with the highest number of listings).
- Explore potential reasons why these hosts are the busiest, considering factors such as availability, price, reviews, etc.
- Support your reasoning with various plots and correlations.

### 7. Custom Visualizations
- Create two additional plots that reveal interesting insights from the dataset.
  - Ensure at least one plot is unique and not used in the above tasks.
  - Explain the insights and any additional observations.

### 8. Visual Appeal and Layout
- For all tasks, include explanations where necessary.
- Ensure the procedure is documented with suitable comments.
- Label all plots and include legends where necessary to enhance visualization clarity.
- Adjust plot sizes and use appropriate color schemes to maximize readability.
- Compile everything in a Python notebook (`.ipynb`).
