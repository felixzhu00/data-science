# Data Science Assignments Overview

This repository serves as an index for the "Data Science" assignment series. Below is an overview of each assignment:

## Assignment 1: NYC Airbnb Data Analysis

This assignment involves analyzing the New York City Airbnb Open Data to uncover interesting observations about different hosts and areas. Key tasks include:

- **Data Cleaning**: Identifying and correcting anomalies in the dataset.
- **Price Analysis**: Analyzing Airbnb prices by neighborhood, identifying the most and least expensive areas.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Conducting pairwise Pearson correlation analysis to uncover relationships between variables.
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Creating scatter plots to visualize the locations and prices of Airbnb listings.
- **Word Cloud Generation**: Generating a word cloud from the names of Airbnb listings.
- **Host Activity Analysis**: Analyzing the busiest hosts and exploring potential reasons for their activity levels.
- **Custom Visualizations**: Creating additional plots to reveal further insights from the dataset.

For detailed instructions and tasks, refer to the [Assignment 1 README](Assignment1/README.md).

## Assignment 2: Electricity Usage Prediction Based on Weather Conditions

This assignment focuses on developing a method to predict electricity usage based on weather conditions. Key tasks include:

- **Data Merging**: Combining weather data with energy usage data.
- **Data Splitting**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets, focusing on December for predictions.
- **Linear Regression**: Building a linear regression model to predict daily energy usage based on weather data.
- **Logistic Regression**: Developing a logistic regression model to classify daily temperatures as high or low.
- **Device-Specific Analysis**: Analyzing usage patterns of specific devices during different times of the day.

For detailed instructions and tasks, refer to the [Assignment 2 README](Assignment2/README.md).

## Libraries Used

Both assignments make use of the following libraries:

- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **WordCloud** (for Assignment 1)
